Dopplegram is meant to replicate the basic functionality of Instagram.

-View a feed of images either ordered by date or by popularity
-See who posted the image, and how many likes/comments an image has received on the feed
-Read comments and see all people who liked an image, on the specific image viewing
-Post comments and like images
-Upload images
-View your own images
-Choose to delete your own images
-Follow other users
-Get notifications for when a user you follow posts and when you receive a like/comment on your image
